### Viewing an Analysis of your Commodities
After you have [created your analysis](Creating an Analysis of your Commodities.md), you will be presented with your results. 

>NOTE: Notice within the upper left menus, the My analysis tab is selected. More information about seeing and working with all your analyses can be found on the [My Analyses](My Analyses.md) page. 

At the top of the Analysis page, under the title of your analysis, a tab bar allows you to navigate to:  

- [**All supplies:**](ViewingAllSupplies.md) view and filter all your supplies and their assoicated issue scores.
- [**Priority supplies:**](ViewingPrioritySupplies.md) view your top 5 supplies along with a map indicating the corresponding grow locations. 
- [**Recommendations:**](ViewingRecommendations.md) this page allows you to view different recommendations: actions you can take, methods to improve your data quality, and resources. 

In the upper left is the **Analysis Settings** where you can change analysis title, update your data, and delete the analysis.
