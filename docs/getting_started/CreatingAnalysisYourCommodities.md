### Creating an Analysis of your Commodities

After you have successfully [created your account](https://portal.commoditymap.org/signup) and signed into the [CommodityMap platform](https://portal.commoditymap.org/my-analyses), you will presented with two options:   

1. **Explore a free demo:** here you can view the results of an example analysis.
2. **Start a new Analysis:** begin the process of creating an analysis.


> TIP: 
> Before continuing, please have available the following information:
>- The commodity or list of commodities of interest.
> - Where the commodities are grown (i.e. the country your commodity is sourced).
> - Supplier names for each commodity & region pair (optional).

> NOTE: 
> There is limit of 20 analyses. 

#### Adding commodities 


1. From the **My Analyses page**, Click **+ Start new analysis.**

2. On the **Start a new analysis** page, click **Go to input form ->**.

3. On the **New analysis** page, type the name of your analysis in the **Name of Analysis** box. 
4. (Optional) Under **Volume unit**, select a measurement.  

5. Under **Your commodities**, click  **+ Add commodity**. 



6. In the **Select a commodity dialog**, select your commodity, and click **Add commodity**. A new row with a gold border at the top appears with the name of commodity. 

**Adding supply data for the commodity or commodities** 

1. Within the new commodity row just added, click **+ Add supply of this commodity**. 
2. In the New Supply dialog, select the **purchasing country** and **quantity purchased** in metric tons. 

3. In response to the question **Do you know where this supply was grown?**: 

    * **Yes:** select the **Country** where the commodity was grown, the **Sub-country** (if known), and the **Sub-sub-country** (if known).


    * **No:** Purchased supply without information about where it was grown will have growing regions modeled by TSC. The result will be the most likely countries from which you are sourcing your commodity. 


4. Optional:  Enter a supplier name and amount spent. 

5. If you have taken actions to address sustainability issues related to the supply, click **+Add action** and select any actions in the supplied list. 

6. Click **Save Supply.** 

7. Once you have completed adding all your commodities and corresponding supplies, create the analysis by clicking **Analyze this data ->.**
