### Overview

CommodityMap gives you insight on environmental and social sustainability issues associated with your agricultural sourcing regions. You can perform an analysis today even if you only know the country into which your commodity is imported! 

CommodityMap will: 

- Help you prioritize your efforts to address environmental and social issues.

- Recommend science-based actions that offer solutions and context to your biggest issues. 

- Help you educate and engage your audience with easy to interpret metrics. 

### How it works

> **CommodityMap:** a innovative sustainability analytics platform that generates insights by way of analyzing the relationship between where you source your agricultural commodity and sustainability issues. 

Rather than providing a traditional geographic map, _think of CommodityMap as a tool which maps out, organizes, and presents insights related to your commodities' impact_. Specifically, CommodityMap delivers an analysis of the environmental and social sustainability issues associated with where you source your agricultural commodities.  

1. **Inputs:** The analysis creation begins by providing certain inputs (Figure A) to a model. The inputs to the model are the agricultural production region of the commodity you have chosen, along with the datasets that represent issue regions and boundaries.   

2. **Modeling:** The model’s job is to use these inputs—specifically the intersection of the agricultural production region and issue regions, to determine a issue score. Issue regions are areas that represent things like high biodiversity hotspots, deforestation, and water-related issues. Additionally social issues based on the country in which the agricultural commodity is grown are also calculated.  

3. **Analysis:** for each commodity-region pair, you will receive a total priority score along individual priorities for each of the environmental and social issues. Additionally, you will receive recommendations for action you can take and resources to achieve your sustainability goals.

### Overview of the Workflow

A common workflow to produce an analysis is as follows:

1. [Create an Analysis](CreatingAnalysisYourCommodities.md)

    
    Here you will enter your commodities and supply (purchasing location) information. 
    
     >NOTE: You just need the purchasing location and CommodityMap will take care of the rest!

2. [View your results](ViewingYourCommodityMapAnalysis.md)


    - View all supplies and sort by priority scores
    - View the top 5 supplies with the highest priorities
    - View recommendations: actions you can take, suggested improvements to the  data you supplied, and resources.
3. [Compare Analysis](../advanced_features/ComparingCommodityMapAnalyses.md)

    After you have created several analysis, you can then compare the analyzed commodities.
