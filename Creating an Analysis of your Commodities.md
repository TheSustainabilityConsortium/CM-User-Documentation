Adding supply data for the commodity or commodities 

In the New Supply dialog, select the purchasing country and quantity purchased in metric tons. 

You are given two options when asked if you know where your supply was grown: 

Yes: you will be prompted to enter the details of where the commodity was grown. Continue with step 3.  

 

No: Purchased supply without information about where it was grown will have growing regions modeled by TSC. CommodityMap will use FAO statistics to determine the most likely country from which you are sourcing your commodity. 

 

If you selected Yes, then select the country where the commodity was grown, the sub-country, and the sub-sub-country. Otherwise continue with step 4.  

(Optional) Enter a supplier name and amount spent. 

Click +Add action and select actions you have already taken to address sustainability issues.
